# Breast-cancer-detection-using-NN
Breast Cancer Detection using Neural Networks | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras  . Built a neural network model to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.  Performed detailed data cleaning, normalization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to enhance model performance.
# Breast Cancer Detection using Neural Networks

This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution for breast cancer classification using a neural network. It involves detailed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.
